Html2xhtml is a command-line tool that converts HTML files to XHTML
files. The path of the HTML input file can be provided as a command-
line argument. If not, it is read from stdin.

Xhtml2xhtml tries always to generate valid XHTML files.  It is able to
correct many common errors in input HTML files without loose of infor‐
mation.  However, for some errors, html2xhtml may decide to loose some
information in order to generate a valid XHTML output.  This can be
avoided with the -e option, which allows html2xhtml to generate non-
valid output in these cases.

Html2xhtml can generate the XHTML output compliant to one of the fol‐
lowing document types: XHTML 1.0 (Transitional, Strict and Frameset),
XHTML 1.1, XHTML Basic and XHTML Mobile Profile.


HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

See doc/html2xhtml.txt in the source code distribution, or the
html2xhtml manpage, for full information about how to run the program.


HOW TO COMPILE AND INSTALL THE PROGRAM FROM THE SOURCE TARBALL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Enter the main directory of the source distribution and type:

$ ./configure
$ make

You can run the test battery in order to check that the program is
working as expected:

$ cd tests
$ ./test.sh
$ cd ..

If you want to install the program in your system, type then (it may
require root priviledges):

$ make install

See ./INSTALL for more information.

The program has been tested to compile on GNU/Linux and Windows (in
both Cygwin and MinGW). If compiled in Cygwin, the program depends
on "cygwin1.dll".


HOW TO COMPILE AND INSTALL THE PROGRAM FROM THE GIT SOURCES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The source code in the Git repository does not include the files
generated by the autotools. In order to build the ./configure script,
run the following commands from the main directory of the sources:

$ aclocal
$ libtoolize
$ touch config.rpath
$ autoheader
$ automake --add-missing
$ autoconf

After that, you should get the ./configure script and proceed as
explained above:

$ ./configure
$ make
